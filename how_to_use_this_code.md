# How to use this code

This book is intentionally short. It focuses on the core features of a well-run worker co-operative, (which entails actively combining business and co-operative principles), rather than providing details about policies and procedures, or a guide to setting one up.

If you are already involved in a worker co-operative, you may want to use it as a health check, looking at those areas where your co-operative works well – or less well. Or you could use it as a way to theme
discussions between members. Many new start worker co-operatives use the Code as a checklist to build a healthy co-operative and an effective business.

If you aren’t a co-operative member, you could see it as a shorthand guide to what worker co-operation aims at. There is an online governance audit for people to work through individually or as a group. More detailed information, examples and tools can also be found at: www.uk.coop/workercode
