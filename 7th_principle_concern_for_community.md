# 7th Principle: Concern for community

Co-operatives work for the sustainable development of their communities, through working according to policies approved by their members.

Co-operative businesses are rooted in community. By building good relations with your local and wider communities, you will create goodwill and opportunities for your coâ€‘operative and members.
Your co-operative should:

1 Actively control the environmental and social impacts of your business.
2 Agree and live up to ethical business standards.
3 Operate high health and safety and worker welfare standards.
4 Prioritise and promote ethical and sustainable initiatives, such as fair trade.
5 Participate in your local, and wider, communities, and promote co-operative principles within them.
