# 3rd Principle: Member economic participation

Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital and finances of their co-operative. Members decide how to use surpluses (profits).

Worker co-operatives should provide the pay and other benefits that members need and want, managing the business to provide them and protect its future.

Your co-operative should:
1 Allocate a percentage of surpluses to collectively owned financial reserves and capital.
2 Ensure that members are enabled to invest in the co-operative if they want to. If members have individual investments, they do not attract additional voting rights.
3 Have a planned and agreed pay and benefits structure, including non-financial benefits.
4 Aim to offer pay and benefits sufficient to sustain long term employment and membership, to enable the co-operative to retain the required skills and experience.
5 Ensure that any surplus in the form of pay and benefits is distributed fairly and equitably between members, relative to their contribution.
