# 4th Principle: Autonomy and independence

Co-operatives are independent, self-help organisations controlled by their members. If they raise capital from external sources, they must maintain their co-operative autonomy.

Worker co-operatives should actively plan and manage their co-operative to be a successful business and avoid becoming over dependent on any funder, supplier or customer.

Your co-operative should:

1. Have good financial controls and management, including cash flow forecasts and internal audits of all parts of the business.
2. Actively manage and assign responsibilities for your operations, personnel, marketing and other business functions.
3. Understand and control risks, both internal and external, facing your co-operative.
4. Build your capability to identify and take advantage of business opportunities.
5. Invest in equipment, premises and technology sufficient to achieve
