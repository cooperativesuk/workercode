# 1st Principle: Voluntary and open membership

Coâ€‘operative membership is open to all workers able and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership.

Worker co-operatives function best as an inclusive team of members with long-term collective interests in the success of the business.

Your co-operative should:

1. Provide all workers with meaningful information about membership and how to join.
2. Provide members with an agreed set of rights and responsibilities, usually as a member job description or membership agreement.
3. Include a probationary period and membership training for workers who want to become members.
4. Offer membership to all workers who are able and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership.
5. Ensure the majority of workers are members and the majority of members are workers.
