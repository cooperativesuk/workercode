# 2nd Principle: Democratic member control

Co-operatives are democratic organisations controlled by their members, setting policies and making decisions. Members serving as elected representatives are accountable to the wider membership.

Worker co-operatives succeed when all members participate in transparent, fair decision making; but also where members are given delegated authority to act on behalf of the collective.

Your co-operative should:

1. Ensure all members actively participate in the management of the business and long-term planning.
2. Effectively communicate, both between the coâ€‘operative and its members and between members themselves.
3. Collectively agree and delegate authority to individual members to act on behalf of the co-operative as and where necessary.
4. Ensure there are democratic processes, or democratic accountability, in all governance and management functions.
5. Regularly review its governance and business management processes as it grows and develops.
