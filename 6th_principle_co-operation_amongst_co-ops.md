# 6th Principle: Co-operation amongst co-ops


Co‑operatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the co-operative movement by working together through local, regional, national and international structures.

Principle 6 is the key to business success for co‑operatives, enabling us to ethically outperform the privately owned opposition.

Your co-operative should:

1 Network with co‑operatives in your locality and industry to share intelligence, understand each others’ business needs and goals, and support each other.

2 Trade with other co-operatives whenever possible.

3 Find and refer new business opportunities to other co-operatives you know and trust.

4 Collaborate with other co-operatives to achieve economies of scale, share costs, access to business opportunities and joint long-term development.

5 Practice fair and honest commercial competition between co-operatives.

6 Join Co-operatives UK and participate in regional and national co-operative activities to promote, develop and grow the co-operative economy.
