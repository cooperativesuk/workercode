# 5th Principle: Education, training and information

Co-operatives provide education and training for their members and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their co‑operatives. They inform the general public about the nature
and benefits of co-operation.

Worker co-operative members should become multi-skilled, so they can participate fully in the management and development of the co-operative.
Your co-operative should:

1 Assess the technical, management and co‑operative skills needed to achieve your long term plans and replace key members who leave.

2 Ensure all prospective members, members and elected representatives receive training in membership and
co-operative skills.

3 Encourage members in specialist roles to obtain technical skills and professional development for current and future needs.

4 Develop and share management skills and techniques to permit efficient co-operative business co‑ordination.

5 Educate business partners, customers and the public about the nature and benefits of co‑operative forms of business.
